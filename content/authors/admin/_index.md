Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in Environmental Science at Indiana University Bloomington, advised by **[Prof. Zhiying Li](https://zhiyingli-geo.com/)**.  
My research focuses on **hydroclimate extremes**, particularly abrupt transitions between dry and wet conditions (*weather whiplash*). I work with large climate datasets, statistical tools, and atmospheric diagnostics to understand the characteristics, drivers, and impacts of these rapid hydroclimate shifts.

I received my M.S. in Marine Geology from Shandong University (China), where I worked with [Prof. Chao Jia](https://www.imst.sdu.edu.cn/info/1246/3217.htm), and my B.E. in Geological Engineering from Taiyuan University of Technology (China).

You can find my Curriculum Vitae [here](https://example.com/fake-cv-link).
