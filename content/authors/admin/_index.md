Hey! I am a Ph.D. student in Environmental Science at Indiana University Bloomington, advised by [Prof. Zhiying Li](https://zhiyingli-geo.com/). I received my M.S. from Shandong University in China, where I worked with [Prof. Chao Jia](https://www.imst.sdu.edu.cn/info/1246/3217.htm), and my B.E. from Taiyuan University of Technology in China.

My research focuses on hydroclimate extremes, particularly abrupt transitions between dry and wet conditions (*weather whiplash*). I work with large climate datasets and statistical tools to understand the characteristics, drivers, and impacts of these rapid hydroclimate shifts. 

You can find my Curriculum Vitae [here](/uploads/CV-TianYang-20.pdf).
