Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in Environmental Science at Indiana University Bloomington, advised by **Prof. Zhiying Li**.  
My research focuses on **hydroclimate extremes**, particularly **abrupt transitions between dry and wet conditions (weather whiplash)**.  
I work with large climate datasets, statistical tools, and atmospheric diagnostics to understand the characteristics, drivers, and impacts of rapid hydroclimate shifts.

I received my **M.S. in Marine Geology from Shandong University** and my **B.E. in Geological Engineering from Taiyuan University of Technology**.

You can find my Curriculum Vitae [**here**](https://example.com/fake-cv-link).
