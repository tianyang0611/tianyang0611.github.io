Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in Environmental Science at Indiana University Bloomington, advised by **Prof. Zhiying Li**.  
My research focuses on **hydroclimate extremes**, particularly **abrupt transitions between dry and wet conditions (weather whiplash)**.  
I use large-sample climate datasets, statistical modeling, and atmospheric diagnostics to understand event characteristics, drivers, and impacts.
